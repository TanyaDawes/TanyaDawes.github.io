            <p>Im inspired to be a Fullstack Developer first to create a homeschooling website for my children. 
                I pursue this knowledge to also help my people the Dine' in anyway this may benefit them.I come 
                from a family of mostly warehouse workers,welders,miners,railroad workers,farmers,
                sheephearders,cooks, and some nurses, but none in Tech. All rewarding and giving occupations no doubt for my people.
                 My mother herself was a weaver,beadworker,farmer,she made & sold food as well.I come from a very small ruraltown in Arizona.
                I have enjoyed the learning process so far with Tech-moms, doing problem solving.
                Switching gears into the Tech world has truly opened my eyes to the huge amount of networking resources and the unlimited library: at a click.
