    <h2 class="intro"></h2>
    <p class="w3-display-container">Hello My name is Antonia Dawes, I am 36 years old & a mother of five. When I started
    Tech-moms I knew nothing of coding or computers expect the very basic.
    I enjoyed learning the beginnings of Front End development.I learned there is all types of
    positions in Tech and many different ways and careers to break into Tech.It is really how much your willing to invest in yourself with
    time,money for resources,schooling,networking, working and learning on the job.
    Im leaving Tech-moms with a new love for coding,planning on futhering my knowledge and to pursue a position one day into Fullstack Development.
    I will be looking into bootcamps,and classes to get certified in lanuages for backend development.Finding ideas to design.Networking with developers,exploring 
    ways that will be convient for me to learn and also that will meet me and my families schedule and needs.
    Im going to practice for now and learn while building projects.I will be looking to enroll into a javascript class and other lanuages for development.
    Also finding a job and learning is something I am willing to pursue right now as well.
